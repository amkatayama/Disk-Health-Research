### SMART (Self-Monitoring Analysis and Reporting Technology)

Smart is a inbuilt system of HDD(Hard Disk Drive) / SSD(Solid State Drive) which monitors the internal information of the hard disk itself. These information can be used to detect the wear and age of hard drives to predict HDD / SSD failures. SMART keeps track of various variables and attributes of the hard disk, for example, how long it has been turned on for. Depending on which quantities we look at, we can come up with an informed guess of which hard disks might be on the verge of wearing out.
